# MiniRISC: A Custom 32-bit RISC Processor

MinRISC (Minimal Simple RISC) is a custom-designed 32-bit RISC processor architecture built from the ground up, capable of performing a wide variety of arithmetic, logical, shift, and memory operations. It includes extended branching and jump capabilities, and has been successfully demonstrated on an FPGA using programs like bubble sort and GCD.

## Features

* **64 General-Purpose Registers** – 4x the register file of MIPS.
* **Extended Branch/Jump Range** –

  * Relative Branch: 128× MIPS range
  * Absolute Jump: 4× MIPS range
* **Arithmetic & Logic Instructions**

  * `ADD`, `SUB`, `AND`, `OR`, `XOR`, `NOT`, `NOR`, `INC`, `DEC`, `SLT`, `SGT`
* **Shift Instructions**

  * `SLA`, `SRA`, `SRL`
* **Other Instructions**

  * `LUI` (Load Upper Immediate)
  * `HAM` (Hamming Weight)
  * `CMOV` (Conditional Move)
  * `MUL`, `DIV`
* **Fully custom ALU operation decoding**
* **Memory & Control Instructions** including loads, stores, branches, and jumps


## Implementation Details

* **Language:** Verilog (Synthesized for Nexys 4)
* **Registers:** 64 general-purpose 32-bit registers
* **ISA:** Custom RISC-style instruction set, extending MIPS-style encoding
* **Pipeline:** Single-cycle implementation (optional for multicycle extension)
* **Assembler:** Custom assembler written in Python 3
* **Simulation/Testbench:** Full test suite validating ALU and control logic

## Demonstrations

* [ ] **Bubble Sort** implemented and simulated 
* [ ] **GCD Algorithm** tested end-to-end on FPGA
* [ ] **Booth Multiplication** with all the intermediate results 
* [ ] All ALU operations verified using custom Python-based assembler and test harness

### FPGA Deployment

Synthesize using Vivado and upload bitstream to your FPGA. 

My Codes were tested upon a Digilent Nexys 4 DDR Artix-7 FPGA.

## Future Work

* Add pipelining or multi-cycle execution
* Memory-mapped I/O for peripheral interfacing
* Support for floating-point operations
* Better assembler error handling and pseudo-instruction support
